COMPILATION INSTRUCTIONS:

1) Navigate to ColorCombination directory with command line and run:
	
	$ make

2) To execute program with an input file named "test_file.txt", run

	$ java ColorCombinationMain test_file.txt




NOTE: Program should be compiled with the javac compiler, should be included with linux machines. The input file should be formed such that all colors are on a single line, each separated by a single comma (no spaces). For example, the input for example 1 from the problem sheet should look like:

blue,green,blue,yellow,red,orange,red,green,yellow,red,orange,purple

The program will terminate execution if there is an odd number of colors. This file should be saved as a text file and stored in the "tests" directory inside the ColorCombination directory.
